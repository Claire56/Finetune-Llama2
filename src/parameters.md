chat_dataset: This parameter is set to "False". It suggests that the model is not using a chat dataset for training. If set to "True", it might indicate that the model is being trained on a dataset specifically designed for chat or conversational data.
enable_fsdp: Set to "True", this parameter likely enables Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), a technique used to distribute model training across multiple GPUs or nodes to handle large models and datasets more efficiently.
epoch: Set to 5, this parameter specifies the number of times the entire dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network during training. Increasing the number of epochs can lead to better model performance but also increases the risk of overfitting.
Instruction_tuned: Set to "True", this parameter suggests that the model has been pre-trained or fine-tuned on a dataset that includes instructions or guidelines for the task it's performing.
int8_quantization: Set to "False", this parameter indicates that the model is not using int8 quantization. Int8 quantization is a technique to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of neural networks by quantizing the weights and activations to 8-bit integers.
Learning_rate: Set to 0.0001, this parameter specifies the learning rate for the optimizer. The learning rate controls how much the model's weights are updated during training. A smaller learning rate can lead to more accurate models but requires more training epochs.
add_input_output_demarcation_key: Set to "True", this parameter might be related to adding a special token or key to the input data to indicate the start and end of the input sequence, which can be useful for models that need to understand the boundaries of the input.
lora_alpha, lora_dropout, lora_r: These parameters are likely related to the configuration of a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) layer in the model. LoRA is a technique for adapting pre-trained models to new tasks with fewer parameters. The specific values suggest a configuration for the LoRA layer, but without more context, it's hard to say exactly what they do.
max_input_length: Set to 1024, this parameter specifies the maximum length of the input sequences that the model can handle. This is important for models that process text, as it determines how much text data the model can take as input in one go.
max_train_samples, max_val_samples: Both set to "-1", these parameters likely control the maximum number of training and validation samples to use. A value of "-1" typically means to use all available samples.
per_device_eval_batch_size, per_device_train_batch_size: These parameters specify the batch size for evaluation and training on each device (e.g., GPU). The training batch size is 4, and the evaluation batch size is 1, which suggests that the model is being trained on multiple devices.
preprocessing_num_workers: Set to "None", this parameter might control the number of worker processes used for data preprocessing. A value of "None" typically means to use the default number of workers, which is often the number of CPU cores available.
sagemaker_container_log_level: Set to 20, this parameter controls the verbosity of the logging within the SageMaker container. A lower number means more verbose logging.
sagemaker_job_name, sagemaker_program, Sagemaker_region, sagemaker_submit_directory: These parameters are related to the configuration of a SageMaker job. They specify the name of the job, the Python script to run, the AWS region to use, and the directory where the code and data are located.
seed: Set to 10, this parameter is likely used to seed the random number generator for reproducibility. Using the same seed ensures that the random processes in the model training (e.g., shuffling of data, initialization of weights) are the same each time the model is trained.
train_data_split_seed: Set to "0", this parameter is likely used to seed the random process for splitting the training data into training and validation sets. This ensures that the same split is used each time the model is trained.
validation_split_ratio: Set to "0.2", this parameter specifies the ratio of the dataset to be used for validation during training. A 20% split is common for training and validation sets.
These parameters are crucial for configuring the training process of a machine learning model, especially in a distributed or cloud-based environment like AWS SageMaker. They allow for fine-tuning the model's performance, resource usage, and the specifics of the training and validation process.
